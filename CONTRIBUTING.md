# I don't code @ Ushahidi 

This project for people who use Ushahidi's open source tools that want to contribute that don't code. 
Primarily for people in international development, activism, volunteering and community development that have a deep understanding of what tools need to do in order to make a positive change in the work that they do.

:heart::sparkle: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :sparkle::heart:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to I don't code @ Ushahidi. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Ushahidi Code of Conduct](https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Code+of+Conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 
Please report unacceptable behavior to [support@ushahidi.com](support@ushahidi.com).

## What should I know before I get started?

Ushahidi is a large open source project made up of over [200 repositories](https://github.com/ushahidi). 
When you initially consider contributing to Ushahidi, you might be unsure about which of those 200 repositories is the right one to look at. 

This project will collect key issues connected to the Ushahidi platform tool that need to be improved. The way that we're asking people to improve these issues is with information.
We're asking people with the knowledge of the kinds of projects that issues directly impact.

For example: [This issue called 'Obfuscation (formerly "Anonymization") v2 #3181'] (https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/3181) Could be really useful for organisations that might be working with populations/beneficiaries that by responding to their deployment could be in danger of violence if their anonymous response information could be used to find our who they are. 
By default, Ushahidi deployments that collect location will place a pin on a map, but if someone went to great lengths, the information plus the location pin could be used to discover someones identity. This 'issue' will allow people responding to the deployment to purposefully 'obscure' their exact location to a general radius of up to 1000km. This could help keep people safe.

An example contribution could be: I work for an organisation that helps domestic violence survivors, this information could be used to find partners after a police visit before a conviction of legal restraining orders are in place. I still want to collect information about what services/items/support domestic violence survivoros need and when they've experienced an incident but I want to be able to have them decide if their location should be obscured or when I make any anonymous datat public I (the Admin) should be able to set a specific location as obscured.

## How Can I Contribute?

We're looking for the following:

* Experiences, anecdotes, research and anonymised scenarios/stories of how the particular issue could help or hinder your work.
* Comments on others experiences, anecdotes, research and anonymised scenarios/stories that adds a new (potentially different) perspective to the issue.
* Formal research or papers written around the subject the issue is tackling.
* Guidance on how or who to approach to see whether a solution to a certain issue has the intended impact or outcome.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to I don't code @ Ushahidi? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` `Community Task` and 'Needs story' issues:

* [Community Task] - Issues that the Ushahidi OSS community is encouraged to contribute to.
